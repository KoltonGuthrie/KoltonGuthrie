# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Kolton

I'm a Senior at Jacksonville State University, and I am majoring in Computer Science

I enjoy programming random projects in my free time

I use many different types of languages in my free time including Java, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL, but JavaScript is by far my most common
